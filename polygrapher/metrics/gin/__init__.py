"""Metrics based on embeddings of random GIN models, as proposed by Thompson et al. [1].

This module provides implementations of metrics for evaluating graph generative models using embeddings from untrained (random) Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs).


Available Metrics:
    - [`RBFGraphNeuralNetworkMMD2`][polygrapher.metrics.gin.RBFGraphNeuralNetworkMMD2]: MMD using an adaptive RBF kernel with multiple bandwidths
    - [`LinearGraphNeuralNetworkMMD2`][polygrapher.metrics.gin.LinearGraphNeuralNetworkMMD2]: MMD using a linear kernel
    - [`GraphNeuralNetworkFrechetDistance`][polygrapher.metrics.gin.GraphNeuralNetworkFrechetDistance]: Fr√©chet Distance in GIN embedding space
