class DobsonDoigGraphDataset(OnlineGraphDataset):
    """Dataset of protein graphs originally introduced by Dobson and Doig [1].

    This dataset was later adopted by You et al. [2] in the area of graph generation. The splits we provide are disjoint, unlike in [2].
    We use the splitting strategy proposed in [3].

    Available splits:
        - `train`: 587 graphs
        - `val`: 147 graphs
        - `test`: 184 graphs

    Graph Attributes:
        - `residues`: Node-level attribute indicating the amino acid types
        - `is_enyzme`: Graph-level attribute indicating whether protein is an enzyme (1 or 2)
