# Installation

## Standard Installation

You can install polygraph using pip:

```bash
pip install polygraph-benchmark
```

Check that it's installed correctly by running:

```python
import polygraph
```

## Installation with Mamba to include `graph_tool`

Since `graph_tool` (which can be optionally used by `polygraph` to do SBM
validity checking, as it uses community detection algorithms that are commonly
used in the graph generation literature) requires C++ dependencies, you need
to install it using `conda` or `mamba`.

```bash
mamba create -n <your_model_env> python=3.10
mamba activate <your_model_env>
mamba install -c conda-forge graph-tool
```

Check that it's installed correctly by running:

```python
import graph_tool.all as gt
```

Note that `graph_tool` is GPL licensed, so any code that uses it must also be
GPL licensed. If you don't want to include it in your project, you can install
`polygraph` without it using the [pip command above](#standard-installation). We
provide BSD-licensed implementations of the SBM graph validity checking
functions in `is_valid_alt`.

<summary><strong>üõ†Ô∏è Development Installation</strong></summary>

We recommend to install the full gamut of dependencies including optional
development dependencies for development purposes to ensure all tests can be
run. Therefore we provide here the steps to create a mamba environment and
install the dependencies there.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/polygraph-eval/polygraph.git
cd polygraph

# Create a new mamba environment
mamba create -n polygraph python=3.10
mamba activate polygraph

# Install graph_tool first to avoid issues down the line
mamba install -c conda-forge graph-tool

# Install the rest of the package and its pip-dependencies.
pip install -e .[dev]
```


### Running the tests
You can then run the tests to ensure everything is installed correctly. To run
the tests in parallel, you can use:

```bash
pytest -n 10 -sv --skip-slow ./tests/
```

To run the tests sequentially, you can use:

```bash
pytest -svx --skip-slow ./tests/
```
