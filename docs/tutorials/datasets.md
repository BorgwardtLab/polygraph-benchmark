# Creating and Managing Datasets

## Storage location and caching directory

Instead of having to specify a path to the dataset, you can set the
`polygraph_CACHE_DIR` environment variable to the path of the directory you want
to use as a cache.

In the terminal in which you want to use the cache, run:

```bash
export polygraph_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache
```
