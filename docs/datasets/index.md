# Datasets

We provide a variety of benchmark datasets:

- [Synthetic Datasets](small_synthetic.md) - Small datasets of synthetic graphs
- [Procedural Datasets](procedural.md) - Similar to the synthetic graphs above, but procedurally generated. Datasets may be chosen to be larger.
- [Real-World Datasets](real_world_topologies.md) - Graphs found in the real world
